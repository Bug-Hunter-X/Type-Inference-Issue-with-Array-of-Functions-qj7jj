This repository demonstrates a type inference issue in TypeScript when working with an array of functions that have different return types. The `operations` array holds functions `add` and `subtract`, both accepting two numbers as input. However, TypeScript fails to correctly infer the type of `result` within the loop because the functions have different return types.  The solution shows how to explicitly type the array to resolve the issue.
